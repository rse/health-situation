**Scraping Current Health Situation Information**

Abstract
--------

This is a small tool for automatically scraping information
about the current health situation during the Corona pandemic. It is not
intended for real public reuse, because it is just a private project and
this code acts just as a sample on how to scrape information which is
located at regularly changing areas in various PDF documents.
The resulting report also contains german explanations only.

Requirements
------------

This software requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)'s `node` and `npm` commands,
[Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/)'s `pdftocairo` command and
[PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/)'s `prince` command in your `$PATH`.
It also requires a running [Browserless](https://www.browserless.io/)/[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)
instance somewhere on the network.
