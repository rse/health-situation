**Scraping Current Health Situation Information**

Abstract
--------

This is a small tool for automatically scraping information
about the current health situation during the Corona pandemic. It is not
intended for real public reuse, because it is just a private project and
this code acts just as a sample on how to scrape information which is
located at regularly changing areas in various PDF documents.

Requirements
------------

This software requires Node.js's `node` and `npm` commands, Poppler's
`pdftocairo` command and PrinceXML's `prince` command in your `$PATH`.
